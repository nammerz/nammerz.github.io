  <h2>Class is about to start.</h2>

   <p>Tonights blog will be about Class. It's not hard to understand but it can be super confusing if you're not catching on quick enough.</p>

<p>Class would be the worldly view. Lets call our class kitchen. Kitchen is the main thing here and inside the kitchen you have all kinds of things i.e. utensils, stoves, fridge, etc.</p>

<p>class Kitchen <~~ kitchen needs to be capitalize to let ruby know its a class</p>

<p>From there if we want to execute a method, we can define a method called initialize. And we'll name it kitchen. And we'll also let it say “ food comes in here!” every time we call Kitchen.new</p>

<p>class Kitchen</p>
<p> def initialize (kitchen)</p>
<p>     puts “Food comes in here!”</p>
<p> end</p>
<p>end</p>

<p> Now we want to access some things in the kitchen, so we'll create fridge and freezer. In order to do that we have to put the “@” sign in front of it. This is called an instance variable.


<p>class Kitchen</p>
<p> def initialize (kitchen)</p>
<p>     puts “Food comes in here!”</p>
<p>   @fridge = fridge</p>
<p>   @freezer = freezer</p>
<p> end</p>
<p>end</p>

<p>If we wanted to put information into @fridge and @freezer, we need to make define a new method</p>

<p> def fridge</p>
<p>   @fridge</p>
<p> end</p>

<p> def freezer<p/>
<p>   @freezer<p>
<p> end</p>
<p>end</p>

<p>We can do anything with that. We can make that method do anything we want like any other ruby methods we define in the past. So if we call fridge, it will do anything that fridge is defined to do. This is just a small class of the greater picture about Class in general. It isn't hard to do or learn but it gets so intertwined but makes things so much organized.</p>
