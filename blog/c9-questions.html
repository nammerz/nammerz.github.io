  <h1>There is Never a bad Question</h1>
  <h2>Only the ones that aren't asked are</h2>
  <h4>30 Mar 15</h4>
<p>My final blog for Phase 0 of DBC will be about questions and how those questions were handled in a bigger scheme of things.<p/>

<p>I first off would like to say that my cohort is absolutely amazing. They are supportive and helpful whenever you need that help. We respond extremely quickly; no more than a few minutes for your questions to be answered. I love my cohort. Maybe its the air here in the Bay Area. The reason I have said all that is because we have a 24/7 Google Hangout Chat. It was created nearly on the first week of Phase 0. To the SF Group, it made sense to do that since we would be working with each other for the next 5 months. The chat isn't just all about coding either. We tell jokes, life stories, current events and of course we keep it as “professional” as we can. Sometimes, PG-13 rated jokes comes out but we keep it very tame. I hear though other members from Chicago and NYC's cohorts that they do not have a 24/7 group chat like we do here. They also say that they are envious of us that we are all so close already. And most of us have not even met each other in person either!</p>

<p>I wonder why they did not create a group chat like us if they saw how convenient it is. Maybe it's the NYC's attitude? Or is it Chicago's lifestyle? We may never know. It really isn't hard to create. I really wish they did because now when the SF cohort starts next week onsite, it'll be a lot easier to talk to each other because we've been doing this for quite some time. For the Chicago and NYC, they may feel uncomfortable since the only way they have been talking is perhaps just the Guided pairing sessions or the pairing sessions that are mandatory to do.<p/>

<p>So now onto the main event – Questions.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't think any of my questions have NOT been answered. They have always been answered thoroughly but nearly everyone. I have asked bad questions where it would be so hard to understand if there wasn't any background to the question and I've asked clear and concise questions and they were answered quickly. It also helps that I have a cohort that is supportive of each other!</p>

<p>So I believe there are a few things that requires for an amazing question vs one that is still confusing:</p>

<p>Clear and concise: make sure that someone can understand the question! The question should have the information that you need answered.</p>

<p>Specific but open ended to answer: If you ask a yes or no question, then you'll get a yes or no answer. If you ask a very general question, your question might not be answered. Get to the point and don't be vague!</p>

<p>K.I.S.S: Keep it short and simple! Self explanatory.</p>

<p>Well, that is it for this weeks blog! I can't wait for onsite to happen!!!!!</p>
