      I think this will be one of my favorite blog post.

      Tech. Tech and its problems today. Think about it. Even look it up. I entered into Google's search engine, “Problems in the tech industry” and what was the first 10 issues that came up? Diversity.

      I have lived in Silicon Valley nearly my entire life with the exception that I lived in other places due to military reasons. I can also personally testify for the diversity issues at hand. When I used to work at a French restaurant in a very ritzy location, I did a lot of private parties for many, many big corporations and companies. These parties were generally either mid level executive parties or group parties of all the lower level workers. I had one instance where a top level executive of Yahoo, think top 5, came in and the lower level executives were on their best behavior. When it came to the executive parties, they consisted of caucasians and male. Rarely would I see either a minority or female sitting amongst them. When it came to the big group corporate parties, it would consist mainly of asian and caucasian males with few females, latinos and African americans. Is there a disparity amongst the technology industry workforce? Of course, but there are reasons why.

      It actually all starts down to the basic level of education. If curriculum is not provided to the younger generation on technology, how can someone be interested in it? I know many people did not want to pursue a career in technology because they did not know how it worked. Of course, technology was not as big as it was today (I graduated high school in 2002, which was when the 1st or 2nd gen Ipod was just being sold I believe). We also now have to go lower than education. We have to think of the upbringing of the younger generation. Were their parents proactive in providing their children the education and knowledge they need? How were the children's lifestyles? When I was going through high school, a lot of the “cool kids” or “jocks” disregarded the hard or “nerdy” courses. Of course this is high school; its all about being popular. The parents still could have a say in it though. My parents said what Bill Gates said, “The nerds will be their bosses” and I never understood that until I started college. In college, I was stuck between wanting to have fun and doing my school work. I fully understood the benefits of college and having to be done but I was also young and was “deprived” of a typical teenage life. It was all about school to my parents and to this day, I wished I had listened to them.

      Let's fast track to today's world. I mingle with a lot of different generations because of my community and the people I hang out with. The common belief amongst the older crowd (27+) is that the younger generation has come to the point where they “don't want to try hard” since every thing is given to them. It's also discussed that the younger generation would rather find a way to do the “get rich quick” scheme rather than invest in their future by doing hard work. I would hear from the younger crowd that complains and ridicule the tech workers that they only got to that point because they had good parents or because they were “nerds in high school and college”. It would always get me mad when I hear that because I believe everyone has a choice to get an education. There are so many scholarships and grants available to the masses. You can also join the military and go to school at the same time since it is paid for. For those who say that they had good parents, I would argue that perhaps it could have contributed to that, but if you knew you had bad parents, then why would you not try to be better? There are so many dynamics to it that it would be hard to figure out why someone truly didn't go into the technology industry.

      Now let's think about being an engineer. How hard is it to learn a language in computer programming? It takes many years to even be an experienced programmer of a certain language. If you're not good at the start, how can one get a job within the industry? A lot of friends of mine who I introduced programming to, tried codecademy and other sites I recommended. They did not get it at all or they found it just too boring or tedious. It takes a certain panache to be a programmer.

      So lets now talk about diversity. What drives someone from doing this is as a career? Why doesn't ethnic minorities get into this? What makes women want to do programming vs those who don't? That is something we have to ask those who really aren't into this. One day we will find out what really is the issue. I don't think we can find out to be honest... I don't think so..
