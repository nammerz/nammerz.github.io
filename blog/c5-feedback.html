   <p>Here in DBC, we pair program all the time. We do it because its required but it also helps when you do it outside of the requirement. If you're stuck on something, you can ask your classmates if they are ok with pairing and you can ask them about your code to see why something may not be working or to show off your code. Whatever the reason it may be, pair programming is awesome. It does have its pros and cons.</p>

<p>I was scared to pair because I was afraid that they will see my faults in programming and how I can't speak the same lingo as professionals. I still to this day (6 weeks in) cannot speak the lingo. I think its very confusing but I definitely need to start learning but anyways.... I got over that fear and it's very welcoming. It could be the fact that whoever you are pairing are also feeling the same. It could be that my classmates are just simply awesome (found out that the other cohorts aren't “proactive” in talking to each other unless necessary).</p>

<p>Pairing can be frustrating too at the same time because if neither of you know how to do the problem, then you're in a stalemate. Where do you go from there? How long should you continue to pair? Should you stop, do some research and come back to it again? You feel like you're wasting so much time just doing that. That's why it can just be annoying or frustrating but that's the benefit of pairing. You get better and better but you also learn to be more supportive and patient. You HAVE to be patient because in the real world, this is what you'll be doing.</p> 

<p>I get feedback from my pairing sessions and I feel happy to receive what they say of me because it let's me know where I am at with the rest of the class. I can be seen as an optimistic person so I always see these comments as ways to better me. We have a process here in DBC: Kind, Actionable, and Specific. These things are what creates our feedback</p>

<p>You need to be kind in how you write your feedback. If you're rude to the other person, then how can the person you're critiquing learn from their mistakes? Kindness goes a long, long way! The golden rule as I see it: Respect.</p>

<p>Actionable is when you let them know what they did or what they can do to be better or what they did that was you saw, made the session amazing or not amazing.</p>

<p>Specific is what you specifically want them to do or what they did. Instead of generalizing it, you go straight to the point and tell them what they did that made you write what you wrote on the feedback</p>

<p>When I read my feedback, I try really hard to better myself based on it. Its quite tough because some of the feedback really is just knowledge based and that takes time to learn. Overall though, I enjoy it very much. For me, its the communication aspect of pairing because I tend to be an introvert only because I am not as smart as the other individuals, but again, that all comes down to just studying the material.</p>
