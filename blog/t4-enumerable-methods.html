      I will be teaching you, Fellow Reader, what .map does. It is pretty complicated but I will do my best to help you understand. Trust me, I am a beginner myself, so this will make it easier for me to explain because if I can explain and teach myself, it shouldn't be a problem for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's use a very, very simple example. We will create an array of names and capitalize each element (the items inside the array) in the array:
    </p>
    <p>
      a = [“mila”, “priscilla”, “carrie”, “taylor”]
    </p>
    <p>
      a.map {|x| x.capitalize}
    </p>
    <p>
     What I have written here is the array (the first line of code) and the .map (second line). The first line is pretty self explanatory. It's just a list of names of my favorite female actors. The second line of code is where the magic happens. I will explain every thing piece by piece. 
    </p>
    <p>
      a.map – this is where “a” (the array) is combined with .map. This tells the computer to run the code and mutate (change) each element inside the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      |x| - is the value that we will be defining.
    </p>
    <p>
      x.capitalize – capitalize is joined with “x”, shown by the “.” between “x” and “capitalize” which means each “x” will be capitalized
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lets combine every thing to understand how it all works!
    </p>
    <p>
      When a.map is combined with {|x| x.capitalize}, we tell the computer to capitalize each element since it  will map the function to each element. Does that make sense? 
    </p>
    <p>
      .map means we run whatever is inside the curly braces “{ }” to the entire array. 
    </p>
    <p>
      |x| x.capitalize} means that anything placed in the double pipes “ | | ” will be touched when it is coded within the curly braces “ { } ” . So if let's say I do this instead - {|y,x| x.capitalize} only “x” will be mutated (changed) but “y” will still remain the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I know this is a lot of mumbo jumbo but hey, I given this entire blog post to someone who's never read code in their life, including HTML and she understood it. Not bad huh? Complicated but not bad.
