<h1>Inhale the Future, Exhale the Past</h1>
<h2>Going through Puberty as a Beginning Programmer</h2>
<h4>07 Feb 15</h4>
<section>
<p>
This is the first week of DBC's Phase 0 prep work. What a week it was! I already feel like I am a programmer just based on that and all we have been doing was just learning about Git and Github. 
</p>
<p>
Our first assignment started off with how we can manage time more efficiently and how we incorporate efficiency with our work. I manage my time through my time in the gym. Yes, the gym. I am in the gym for 2 hours so this “forces” me to manage my time throughout the day. And as everyone knows, the gym allows me to take stress of the shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Our assignments then shifts toward the real work which is the command line. You open terminal and if you want to know what folder you are in, you can type “ls” and it'll show you what directory you currently are in. “cd [folder name]” opens up the folder you named. There is so much more to write about the command line that it would literally bore the read if I kept doing that but in general you can command anything you want through terminal and work within it.
</p>
<p>
We then taught ourselves on how to fork and clone repositories. The reason why we do that is because it allows developers at the local level to write code and not affect other developers. Once the code is complete, this code can be pushed onto the master repositories, which allows all the other developers to see it. 
</p>
<p>
We also taught ourselves how to create our own website in which this is the website I created!!! I have to admit that it was pretty darn amazing to see what I am doing here translate into the real world. What an amazing week it has been!
