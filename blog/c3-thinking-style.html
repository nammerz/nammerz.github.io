      What a crazy, crazy week this has been for phase 0. This has been such a fun but difficult week for me. I have been going through personal problems in my life and to be able to balance that with programming was extremely hard for me. What makes me able to do this was the fact that I was lucky enough to have studied Ruby prior to getting accepted into DBC.

      As I sit here trying to think of something to write, I think about how I am doing up to this point since day one of phase 0. I think the biggest struggle for me has been the CSS aspect. It is so confusing for me. I have yet to have my website up to the point where it looks better than a 5 year old kid messing around with HTML. It really is disturbing. I mean, if you look at it, you might even question me as a programmer. I personally don't think it is my learning style that has caused me to not perform the way I want to be at. I really wish we can learn with instructors or something. I understand we have tutoring and paired sessions but I'd like more of that. I understand why DBC does this but I'd like to be taught more of all this. 
    </p>

      I think in order for me to learn more efficiently is to do more pairings. I believe if I muster enough courage to ask people, then perhaps it will allow me to finally build my website that I have always wanted. I have started asking people for help through Google Hangouts, so I think I am right on track with doing all this.
