  <p>This weeks blog will be about how I resolved a conflict in my life. If you have been reading any of my posts, I am pretty liberal in how I speak. Some would say that I am almost telling my life story but for me, I believe that if you know where I came from, you can understand how it is like to live and be in my shoes.</p>

<p>I've gone through many conflicts in my life, some I dealt with in the way all conflicts should be dealt with – learning and moving on. Others, well, that didn't go so well. We'll talk about those.</p>

<p>Once conflict that stands out in particular, ( I spoke of it last week) which has allowed me to be where I am at today, was my divorce. This conflict changed the outcome of my future.</p>

<p>I left for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on 12 April 2014 for military duty. Starting from the moment I landed on the island, I noticed my wife stopped saying, “I love you” and even trying to have a conversation. She responded with very few words. It was devastating on my side as I didn't know what was happening. This happened nearly every day that I was out there, so I took action. I decided to call her the first week of may and asked her what is wrong and what is making her feel this way. She felt that she needed to be single again. Her reasoning is that she wanted to experience life and travel the world. She wanted to date other men. She also stated that she was envious of my lifestyle, which was being in the military and being able to travel. This shocked me. It literally felt like I was hit by a train. That feeling was like someone ripping my heart out and just jumping and stomping on it. It was so hard to breath. I cried all day that morning. That event led to me having a very unsatisfactory military deployment as it caused me to do things I am not proud to say.</p>

<p>It was hell.</p>

<p>I did not know what to do. I was the first member on this deployment to go through a divorce and it was only one month in. My shipmates were amazing assets to me. They let me cry on their shoulders, spoke about my pain and downed my sorrows away. I love my shipmates and will do anything for them. The one thing they all said to me was that I needed to go home and fix this because if I don't, she could use this against me. So I agreed. I made the trip home. I believed that this was the trip that would resolve and save this marriage. This trip home was a  razor sharp double edge sword.</p>

<p>I came home and confirmed all my assumptions. All I could do was cry in bed. Every day I was home, I cried. It was such an agonizing pain. Your heart really throbs in pain. I grabbed my pillow and just held hard. It was so hard to breath. I was literally suffocating as I sobbed. Outside of my groomsmen no one back at home knew what was happening. This was all kept secret so both my ex and myself could save face.</p>

<p>So what did I do to resolve all this? I had 12 days of liberty before I was required back on the island for 6 more months. Well, fortunately, I have such amazing groomsmen. One of them would would be the x-factor in all this. And if he could read this, thank you.</p>

<p>He also went through the same exact thing half a decade earlier. He and I talked this over at a local Irish Pub. He knew how painful this was for me. He told me how he dealt with it and he said that he would not change anything. That right there confused me. How would you not want to change what happened? He explained that if he did not go through that event in his life, he would not be where he was at. I wondered why and asked. He replied by saying that he is back to what he wanted to do, which was being a computer programmer. I was very happy for him. He was able to overcome adversity and did what he wanted to do after that. He then told me to do what I wanted to do. He knew I was into computers and technology and suggested something that I never knew existed. He asked me if I knew anything about programming boot camps. I obviously did not and so he continued to talk about how that all went about. He said there are many different boot camps and you just have to pick what type suits your style and what you want to do when you grow up. I didn't know what that meant so I had to look that up. He said it starts off with studying on your own to prep for the interview. Then when accepted, you enter the online portion and from there onto the onsite portion. After you graduate you can get hired by companies in the Bay Area. I thought that was amazing. All the fluff is gone and only content to get you going as a programmer. He said it will be one of the hardest things that you do educationally but it will be absolutely worth it. I told him I'll do it.</p>

<p>Here I am, writing a blog on conflict and how I ended up doing something I am actually enjoying! As you can see why now, how this was a razor sharp double edge sword.</p>

<p>As I sit here and wonder would I really honestly go back and change all this if I had a time machine? This is very hard to answer. My divorce is still fresh and I never wanted to have this divorce. As each day passes by, I come to terms with myself and my life that I would not do anything differently because if I did, I would have not been placed in this strangely, amazing situation. I am one week away from being onsite and only 3 months away from graduating from a program I wish I had known since the beginning. It is also because of this situation that allowed my roommate to get a full paid scholarship into another programming bootcamp. He has been ever thankful to me.</p>

<p>This has been a roller coaster ride for me this past year. 2014 has been the worst year of my life. The amount of pain is indescribable but as fate would have it, here I am. My life has changed, in 3 months we'll find out if it is for the better...</p>
