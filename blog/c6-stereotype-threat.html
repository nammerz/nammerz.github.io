   <p>Today's blog post will be about a very touchy subject but it is seen from educational institutions to the work place. This subject is called Stereotype Threats.</p>

<p>Claude Steele's definition of Stereotype threats “refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.” What this essentially means is that if there is a negative stereotype about one's group and you are a part of that particular group, you risk the chance of exhibiting that stereotype if you believe in that stereotype. Steele conducted experiments confirming some of the academic stereotypes of certain groups. He also confirmed that if there was no threat to that particular group, they perform just as well or better than the other tested group. Steele provides these examples and describes that as long as you do not conform to the stereotype that you will not have any issues.</p>

<p>Can I personally say that I have been affected by these threats? Yes, I have but not academically. I remember going through high school and reading a historical comic strip about how Asians are hard workers, humble and respectful. What the comic strip also described was that Asians were also very timid, short, and unconfident individuals. This comic strip made sense to me as I read it. I was a straight A student and didn't do anything outside of the ordinary when it came to education. I was also very timid, short (5'3” at the time) and extremely unconfident. I believe it had to do with my upbringing from my parents. They always taught me that school is the most important thing and doing anything outside of that will affect your chances of going to a good college. I did listen to them but it also affected me at an emotional and physical level. They did not allow me to go hang out with friends at any time. They wanted the entire family to stay at home as it was considered “safe” and warranted no risks. I was not taught how to be social at my age since I could not interact with peers of my age outside of high school. So during high school, I didn't really respond well to people talking to me. I did have friends but I was considered an “emo” or a “loner”. </p>

<p>After reading that comic strip, I was surprised at how accurate it was. Fortunately, I mustered up courage and did something not many Asians would normally do, I tried out for the high school football team. You may wonder, what does that have to do with stereotype threats? Well, typically, Asian parents push their children to do anything that can academically excel them. Obviously that means doing better in their studies but that also means taking music classes with two instruments being priority because it is considered to develop intelligence better than the others – piano and violin. When it came to sports, any contact sports was forbidden and only two sports were considered “safe” and they were badminton and tennis. I went against the grain and tried for the team in which my entire Vietnamese community was extremely worried and wanted me to quit (to this day, I am the only person in my Vietnamese community that tried out and made the team).</p>

<p>I rebelled against their wishes and made the team. I knew this was my way to being more confident and not be a part of the stereotype. All my team mates thought I would not make it because I was small and weak. I worked so hard to prove everyone wrong. I didn't perform as well as other individuals because I was not provided the same support as other members on my team. For example, if my son or daughter wanted to try out for football, I would buy them the best shoes and best equipment available. I would provide proper nutrition and extra training they need to excel. My parents weren't too keen on providing that as they said it was not “necessary” since I could still perform. For example, my parents felt that I did not need to have cleats since I already have tennis shoes. I had to literally provide evidence and proof that would warrant them to purchase the cheapest pair of cleats. I played football for 3 years in high school and it was one of my most enjoyable memories.</p>

<p>Going through DBC, I understand how difficult this may be to many of my classmates, that's why I am always optimistic when I speak to them, outside of the frustrating code that we have to complete. I tell them I am thankful for who they are and do not take their help for granted. I want to show that we are all here for one thing and thats to learn how to code. I've notice that a certain classmate was extremely frustrated and was considering leaving DBC.</p>

<p>I said to her, “Please don't quit because I won't.”</p>

<p>I did not realize the impact of those words until someone mentioned it after an hour later. She said those words were the most encouraging words out of all conversations up to that point of our training. It was from that point that I realized that my words does affect people and that I needed to continue to be supportive and optimistic for everyone. I worry though that my optimistic personality will affect my coding but I believe that as I continue to have a positive attitude, people will come to my help when I need it as well.</p>

<p>It is amazing how a topic such as stereotype threats can open me up to the world but I believe it needs to be known so others can be empathetic and sympathetic to other's needs. Keep that head up everyone! Be positive and always think of ways to better yourself. Climb that mountain and reach the summit because when you do, you'll realize that its darn with the trip.</p>
