I think what makes the lifestyle of DBC is the fact that everyone is in it together. It's weird how its no problem to pay tens of thousands of dollars to go to college and we just shrug it off because it simply is just college. We see DBC as a different investment. You literally are sacrificing you're entire life for 6 months or more depending on how long you study and prep. You move to the few locations that DBC offers, you say goodbye to family and friends. I think what makes it harder for some to swallow is the fact that its an investment after you had some college education. Most people will normally invest twelve thousand dollars for a vehicle, or a down payment on a home but for education to propel you into the field of programming? Some would call that insane.

So the big question is how ready am I for this new lifestyle? Will I be ready for a 6 am to 10 pm work lifestyle? Will I be ready to code for hours on end? I think what makes this more palatable is the fact that everyone who is part of this lifestyle is in it together. The saying, “We will ride together, we will die together”, can't be more from the truth. All of our classmates will become family and because we will become family, we will support each other and not let anyone fail. This is what I hope to believe happen. We all want to succeed and we all don't want to see anyone fail or drop out. I am more than ecstatic for this course to happen already.
