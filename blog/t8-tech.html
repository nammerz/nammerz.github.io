<p>Ruby on rails... this will be one of the biggest things we will learn in DBC and here I am, attempting to explain what it is. Will I be able to do it? Based on my experience, probably not. But I'll try!</p>

<p>Ruby in itself is a programming tool. It is simply for web programming. It is considered a simple programming tool that many start ups use because of its simplicity and how it can interpret what the start ups want to use it for.</p>

<p>Rails on the other hand is framework for building beautiful websites. Rails is a package manager which allows Ruby to use in conjunction. It also adds structure by allowing allowing collaboration and maintenance. By adding Rails to Ruby, start ups can build very complex sites because of the amount of open source software libraries that Rails can implement.</p>

<p>Rails has 4 guiding principles:</p>
<p>Rails is opinionated- if you follow the conventions of Rails, that is, there is a certain way to do things the “Rails way” then development and production is faster, which in turn reduces costs and allows for easier maintenance. </p>

<p>Rails is Omakase- what this means is that you'll leave it to rails to do the job. Omakase is what that means. You're entrusting Rails to do its job seamlessly. How was that possible? Well when Rails was being developed, they developed it according to what would make a “tasty full-stack framework”.</p>

<p>Convention over Configuration- this is where I am a bit confused on what this means. As explained on the link, Rails automatically assigns a setting or value without user intervention but that would mean it follows under Rails is opinionated. It says Rails makes assumptions, so if you made an object that is singular, Rails will also assume that the plural version is the case. I guess I will learn what this principle means as it comes through experience.</p>

<p>Don't repeat yourself- Using repetitive code increases the chance of buggy code. Rails on the other hand can eliminate duplicate code and is said is even possible to make simple web applications with a few lines of code. Amazing isn't it?</p>

<p>Now let's talk about how Rails actually works with websites. In websites, three files are used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML creates the actual texts and generic layout. CSS allows designs to use with HTML. Finally JavaScript makes websites interactive. Now when you work with Rails, you can also use Ruby in conjunction with the other three. Using Rails also allows you to use other developer's code which has been tested and worked with so you don't have to build everything yourself.</p>

<p>I really appreciate all that have taken the time to read this. I don't know too much about Rails but I hope this clears it up not just for you but for me as well.</p>
