  <h1>The happiest, proudest, most satisfied events</h1>
  <h2>The feelings that came from that</h2>
  <h4>19 Mar 2015</h4>

  <section>
<p>Today's blog entry will be a detailed portion of my personal life. It will be about what and when I felt the most happiest, proudest and satisfied moments of my life.</p>

<p>Shall we begin?</p>

<p>I've been given a list of values that we are to pick that represents what I felt most from these moments. From that list, I felt a lot of those values, I felt a lot of the values work hand in hand, so I picked those that were most relevant and that hit most of the values. Even then, those values that I chose still work hand in hand. Those values were:</p>

<p>Accomplishment</p>
<p>Achievement</p>
<p>Patriotism</p>
<p>Personal development</p>
<p>Public service</p>
<p>Will power</p>

<p>We'll start off with the earliest moment in my life that led to who I am today – Graduation. I am quite smart but I am extremely lazy and indecisive. It took me 11 years to finally finish college. It only took so long because of many life events that happened. I went to San Jose State University to earn a Computer Science Degree but that didn't happen. I got bored of what was being taught. Then from 2003to 2008, I wanted to become a dentist, so I took the pre-dental courses that are required to get into dental hygiene at San Jose State University and Cal State Hayward (now called CSU East Bay). In between those years, I moved to Hawaii. I attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa because I wanted to explore life and myself. It was an amazing year during the one year I attend the University. Unfortunately, none of the classes transferred over when I moved back home and attended CSUEB. I heard they lost their accreditation. That was when I also changed my minor to Dance as I was exposed to the lifestyle in Hawaii.</p>

<p>I was always told when it came to school and your career, you should do something that you can do for your entire life. I wanted to dance and so I took many ballroom courses at CSUEB. I ended up being an assistant instructor, unofficially. Then something happened.</p>

<p>My dad died.</p>

<p>This had a devastating effect across my entire family as it separated all of us as individuals instead of a family, but that is another story that can be talked about later. After the funeral, I decided that I needed to do something with my life as I have been in college for 5 years and getting no where. All my friends had graduated already but I was only 4 classes away from graduating with a Biology major with a dance minor. This was when I decided to get into <u>Public Service</u>.</p>

<p>I joined the United States Coast Guard</p>

<p>Prior to me joining, I had coaches from CSUEB train me to get ready for whatever may be thrown at me in Boot Camp. I trained for a hard month and boy, did it help. Boot Camp was actually, surprisingly easy. Was it the coaches that prepped me for it? Or was it because Boot Camp was actually really easy? Whatever the reasons are, I had an amazing time. Yeah, it was tough. Stressful at many times during my 8 week stay. In the end, that was when I became <u>Patriotic</u>. I wasn't the hardcore patriot that you'd see down south but I was extremely proud that I can say I am part of the military and that I conquered Boot Camp. That was my favorite <u>Accomplishment</u>. </p>

<p>After Boot Camp, I decided that I wanted to be a public servant for my community. I wanted to be a Peace Officer so I decided to change my major. I went back to CSUEB to major in Criminal Justice Administration.</p>

<p>As you can see from what you have read, I have jumped from Computer Science, to Dental Hygiene, to Criminal Justice. I was never consistent because I never found something I enjoyed and saw I could do for the rest of my life at the time. Now you're probably wondering, what happened next? Well if you really want to know what happened next, I was deployed to the Middle East was what happened next. My unit in the USCG was activated to deploy to Kuwait and Iraq in from August 2009 to august 2010. This deployment was a first for nearly everyone in my entire unit. We did not know what to expect and fortunately, nothing “serious” happened. This deployment was a long and drawn out one. Work for 2 to 3 weeks straight with one day off. It was terrible but as soon as we landed in San Francisco International Airport, the entire planed erupted in applause, screams, yahoo's, hugs, and some with tears. That feeling... a feeling that can only be earned. To be away from your family, friends, and loved ones. That feeling is indescribable. That feeling can be described as <u>Accomplishment</u>.</p>

<p>It is not just that but its everything else. We all postponed our careers, school, life to handle this mission. We all started to have this feeling of confusion and other things that is quite difficult to describe. We all agreed that life is now going back to normal. I went back to school to finally attempt to finish my degree at CSUEB and finish I did. In 2013, I finally earned my degree in Criminal Justice. To me this was an amazing <u>Achievement</u> as it took me 11 years to complete and racking over 80 grand in school loans. You know what's funny though? The story isn't even finished...</p>

<p>Guess what happened in 2014? My unit, again, was selected to deploy. This time, we deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba from January 2014 to January 2015. This deployment was emotionally hard on me. I was in a 5 year relationship at the time. So being away from my loved one was extremely tough. What made this so emotionally hard was the fact that..... well.. this is hard for me to say on my own blog...</p>

<p>I received a “Dear John Letter” from my wife.</p>

<p>She decided that she wanted to be single at the beginning of the deployment and it destroyed my morale and self-esteem all through deployment. I could not believe this was happening to me. I cried and cried some more. Whenever I thought of her, all I could do is cry. I wanted this deployment to be a stepping stone for her and me. I wanted to buy a home and pay off all our debt. My dream to do this for her was all for naught. This was the hardest, most emotional year of my ENTIRE life.</p>

<p>As cliché as it sounds, every cloud has a silver lining.</p>

<p>During my deployment, my good friend introduced me into... can you guess?</p>

<p>DBC!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I found it uplifting and encouraging because I wanted to do this for myself and to show my now ex-wife that I can overcome what she put me through. From August 2014 to November, I worked hard to study Ruby through Tealeaf Academy and Codecademy. November was when I finally decided to apply and well... I wouldn't be writing this blog if I wasn't accepted right? DBC was happy to accept me and now here I am, two weeks away from being onsite for Phase 1. It has been such a journey. What an <u<Achievement</u> this has been. My cohort, friends, family has all been supportive of what I have been doing. They encourage why and what I am doing this for. I have been loving every moment of this. I kept my head up and I maintained the <u>Willpower</u> that I had left in me.</p>

<p>Each one of those values I live up to as best I can. If it were not for those values, I would not be here today. Literally.</p>

<p>My room mate asked me about why we deserve to be in these programming boot camps (he's attending Maker Square and also deployed with me) and I said because we worked so hard to be where we are at and we have to continue to work hard for ourselves and our families. We were away from our loved ones for so long and we made most of what we could do out there. So lets continue that momentum because it'll be worth it in the end.</p>

<p>When I think of my values, I can say it has allowed me to persevere through all this. I've been trained mentally, physically, and unfortunately emotionally. But I personally think if it wasn't for what has led up to this in my life, I wouldn't even be attending DBC. Things happen for a reason and perhaps this is the reason. I think with my experience, it will help motivate those who feel in the dark or lost or even perhaps who want to give up in DBC. I wont let it happen and fortunately, I don't think anyone in my cohort will either. We have such a great cohort, Chicago and NYC is even jealous of how close we all are!</p>

<p>This has been a very detailed life about me. I am ashamed of what happened to me during my deployment. I do NOT feel proud that I am divorced. But as many others have said to me and I will say to others, “Look into the light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
