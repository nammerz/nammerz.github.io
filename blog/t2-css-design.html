<h2>Borders, margins and padding, oh my!</h2>

  In order to make really beautiful websites, designers need to have an understanding of borders, margins and padding. This will allow the image or text to be placed properly and cleanly. If a designer does not know that, then the images and/or text would overlap, be outside of the webpage, or create too much space between the content itself, etc.
</p>

<p>
  We'll start off with margin. Margin is the furthermost box. It is the boundry line in which, if the code is correctly done, nothing enters that line. I believe if I a had researched correctly, margins are also transparent as well. From the margin you can set the space as small or as big as you like. Think of it as a picture frame. The space outside the picture frame is the the margin. So from the margin itself we go to the border.

  Borders is what goes around the padding and content. So if we think of our picture frame, the margin is the space outside the picture frame, the border would be the the actual frame that surrounds the "white space of a picture frame" This border can be of different designs like double lined, solid lined, shaded etc.

The white spacing is the padding of the the picture frame. Padding can be of different size. You can say this is the actual barrier that surrounds the content.
